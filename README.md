## Hello and Welcome to my Project Yariga.

In this project, I'm excited to showcase the power of the MERN stack by building a fully functioning website using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js. To give the website a clean and modern look, I'll be using Material UI, which is the most popular UI Component Kit nowadays.

What makes this project unique is that I'll be using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to your code.

Throughout the project, I'll be taking a Figma design and transforming it into a fully functioning website. I'll also be optimizing images and storing them on the cloud using Cloudinary, which will improve the website's performance.

To provide a quick and easy way for users to log in and register, I'll be using Google Auth. This will allow users to sign in using their Google accounts, which is a convenient and secure way to manage user authentication.

Using refine, a React-based library to further my knowledge.
